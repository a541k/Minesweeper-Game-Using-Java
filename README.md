# Features:
1. BG-music and sound effect
2. Different difficulity levels

## About:
I completed this project on my academic Java sessional. The requirement of the sessional was to create something using java swing, javafx, should have guest log in/profile create features...


## NB
res File contains audio and png files that are used in this game.
'theme.wav' (background music) file is missing here(res) due to it's size. The game should still run without it.
N.B. These audio files and some of the png files were taken(some were modified later) from different online sources.

## How To Run
1. Load the project on any java IDE.
2. Modify the directories of res files in the code to their new directory(e.g.: ImageIcon gb= new ImageIcon("C:\\Users\\hp\\Documents\\java\\res\\11.png"); 
   in this statement change the directory of 11.png(i.e. "C:\\Users\\hp\\Documents\\java\\res\\11.png") to it's new directory.
3. Run

### improvements that can be done:
1. flag adding feature
2. animation etc
